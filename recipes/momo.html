    <strong>Step 1 Chop the vegetables and wash chicken</strong>
<p>Chicken Momos is a dish that needs no introduction. However, it is pretty easy to prepare it at home without putting in much effort. Here’s how you go about preparing it at home: To begin with, rinse the veggies and chicken with lukewarm water to thoroughly clean them. Then take a clean chopping board, chop the vegetables separately and keep them aside.</p>

    <strong>Step 2 Boil the chicken and then shred well
    </strong>
    <p>Then take a pan or a pressure cooker and boil the chicken, with a pinch of salt and pepper. If you want to make it aromatic, you can add a small teaspoon of ginger and chilli garlic paste. If you like the flavour of garlic, you can add some more garlic paste. Once done, carefully mince the boiled chicken. Keep it aside.</p>

    <strong>Step 3 Prepare the dough and filling for Chicken Momos</strong>
    <p>Now, take a deep mixing bowl and add refined oil in it followed by all-purpose flour and salt. Mix well with enough water and knead the mixture into a smooth dough. Knead well and ensure that no lumps are formed. Take another mixing bowl and add chicken followed by chopped vegetables, mix well and combine everything together. Then, add soy sauce to the chicken mix and stir well. Now take the prepared dough and roll out small balls out of it.</p>

    <strong>Step 4 Flatten the dough balls and fill it with chicken stuffing, and steam for 20 minutes
    </strong>
    <p>Using a rolling pin, flatten the balls in a square shape and add the chicken and veggies stuffing at the centre. Bring the edges close and secure them to make a momo. Repeat this step with the remaining balls. Transfer the prepared momos to a steamer and steam for 20 minutes or until they turn soft and tender. Serve fresh and hot with your choice of chutney or dip.</p>
